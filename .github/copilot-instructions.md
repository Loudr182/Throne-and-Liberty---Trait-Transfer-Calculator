This is a React + Vite project for a Trait Transfer Calculator. The application logic is based on the static HTML/JS version, but all UI and state management should use React functional components and hooks. 

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Support multiple languages via JSON files in public/assets/translations.
- Components: LanguageSelector, RulesSection, T1ItemsSection (with T1Item, TraitSlider), T2ItemSection (with TraitSlider), MaxOutButton, TotalBlessingsDisplay, T2BlessingStatus.
- The first T1 item has special blessing rules.
- The main menu should show images for T1→T2 and T2→T3 processes.
- The app must be fully responsive and mobile-friendly.
